## 🧠 About Me

I'm an embedded systems enthusiast who thrives on exploring the inner workings of microcontrollers, microprocessors, and the low-level logic that drives real-world electronics. Whether it's designing a custom chip layout, troubleshooting a tricky bus conflict, or squeezing performance out of limited firmware — I find joy in the challenge.
Having an experience of 4+ years in embedded industry,  I've worked on a variety of hands-on projects that span embedded firmware development, signal processing, system simulation, and  product design. 

 A quote that I live by - 

`"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."`
